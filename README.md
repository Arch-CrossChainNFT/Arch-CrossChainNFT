## Project Inspiration
With the increasing popularity of NFTs and the growing ecosystem of the Cosmos network, there was a clear need for a unified platform to trade NFTs across various chains. By leveraging the low fees and sustainability of Archway, we aimed to create a marketplace that not only addresses this need but also fosters the growth and adoption of NFTs in the Cosmos ecosystem. Our goal is to provide users with a seamless and efficient trading experience, contributing to the overall development of the blockchain space.
